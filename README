NAME
    Stardoc - Acmeist Documentation Toolset

SYNOPSIS
        use Stardoc;

DESCRIPTION
    Stardoc is a toolset for making programming documentation easier.

    It is intended to one day be a way to write Acmeist documentation. That
    is, documentation that you write once, and it works in all programming
    languages.

WARNING
    This is a very early release. Don't use Stardoc yet. Things are still
    being worked out.

CURRENT USAGE
    Right now, you can use it to simplify your Perl module docs.

    Take a look at the source code for this module. The POD lacks several
    standard sections. These sections are generated from the information
    provided in the special Stardoc section at the top.

    The Stardoc section starts with "##" and contains a YAML map or
    metadata.
